/**
 * One OKLCH channel as a slider whose track shows what that channel can do.
 * Sweeping lightness, chroma, or hue while the other two hold still traces a
 * line through the gamut, and the track paints exactly that line: color where a
 * screen can show the result, bare track where it cannot. Move any slider and
 * the other two redraw, so the shape of what is reachable is visible while you
 * work rather than something to be learned.
 *
 * The tracks say nothing about sRGB specifically. What a narrow display would
 * make of the color is a question about the color itself, not about a position
 * on an axis, so ColorPopoverContents answers it with a side-by-side swatch.
 *
 * Three of these replaced a 2D plane. A 2D slice of the gamut is a curved shape
 * that has to be squashed into a rectangle somehow, and every way of doing that
 * makes something drift when the hue moves; a 1D slice is just an interval.
